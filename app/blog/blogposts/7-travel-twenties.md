I lived in six countries between the ages of 19 and 25.

It was a dream cometh true for my younger self who wanted unbridled adventure and novelty. I started off with a flight to Turkey, where I spent ten months studying architecture and design. Then, I transferred to Minerva University in San Francisco, which had a global rotation program that took me to Korea, Indonesia, Germany, and the UK over the course of my undergrad education. There were a few other countries I visited too, but those were shorter trips that feel like a blip in comparison.

At 19, I barely knew myself. I did not know much about the world either. I had so much to discover with an endlessly curious mind. Traveling during this time was one of the best catalysts for my character arc.

Here is a list of things that worked surprisingly well for me, in addition to things that I wish someone had told me before I started on my journey:

### 1. Travel slow

Short trips are usually an escape from a default life you have somewhere else. Longer trips force you to be present where you are.  

The shortest time I lived in one location was three months, and the longest was one year. Longer chunks of time allowed me to immerse in a city more fully. I'd naturally start caring about the same things as locals, such as groceries, modes of transport, neighborhoods, gyms, and social life. In every city that I lived, I ended up being a frequent customer to at least one cafe where the cashier knew my order. 

The longer I stayed in a location, the more meaningful and fulfilling it felt to be there. I ended up forming a unique, intimate relationship with each place, so much so that I no longer believe in the concept of a "favorite city".  

### 2. Travel solo 

Traveling alone will put you in unexpected situations where you will need to spontaneously problem-solve, plan ahead, practice discernment, communicate with strangers, and learn to collaborate. If you travel with others, there is less pressure on you to exercise these muscles to the same extent. 

Even though I had been traveling since 19 with friends and classmates, I did not fully experience solo travel until I flew to Bali at 21. Two months after I landed, the airports shut down and the Indonesian government automatically extended all tourist visas. I found myself alone on a faraway island at the weirdest time our generation has experienced. 

I spent a year in Bali during lockdown, and during this time, I learned how to show up for myself in ways that I would not have were I traveling with my classmates. 

### 3. Choose your window of discomfort wisely

If you are too uncomfortable for too long, it will dysregulate you, and if you are too comfortable, it will stagnate you. There is a sweet spot between dysregulation and stagnation, where you will grow immensely. Find the window where challenge feels productive. Traveling the world provides ample opportunities for pushing your boundaries. However, travelers and nomads have a notorious tendency to sensationalize leaving one's comfort zone. Learn to discern when it is wise to do so, and when you need to take a step back. 

### 4. Use recommendation engines sparingly

If you go to major western cities, you'll find that globalization has flattened differences between them. After a while, every place starts to rhyme with every other place. This is the tourist trap, and the way to escape it is to ignore things recommended to you by the search engine, AI, or people on social media. Instead, get to know the locals, and be extremely curious about their lives. You'll learn what it is actually like to live in the city, and in time, you might find yourself invited to a dinner, a wedding, or a boat ride in a secret lake. 

### 5. Speak to people a few decades older than you

We naturally want to spend time with people our age, but when you are 20 and you speak to a 35 year old person, you are presented with an option of a life you can live. There are fifteen years of choices, behaviors, preferences, ideals, and mistakes between you and this future person of you. Traveling is a great way to meet a large diversity of people who can tell you how they arrived where they are. As you do this, you will naturally think about who you want to be and the values you want to embody as you move through the coming decades of your life. This is an excellent thing to do at the start of your twenties. 

### 6. Explore voraciously until you know what you like and dislike 

Do not be in a rush to adopt a persona, brand, or way of being. Instead, do everything across the whole spectrum of things-to-do. Wake up at 5am and run to the beach for sunrise. Or go to a nightclub and dance until 5am. See what each feels like. Do an internship at a tobacco company, or offer to model for an aspiring-photographer. The more things you do, the more you will learn what you like, what you dislike, and what really isn't all that you thought it was going to be.

### 7. Commit to learning a new type of physical activity

This is my favorite trick because it checks multiple important boxes at once. You get to try an entirely new skill or hobby in a meaningful and concerted fashion. You get into the habit of regular fitness. You become stronger and/or more agile. You start to feel competent at something which makes you feel good about yourself and your body. And importantly, you instantly become part of a tight-knit community in a new place where you don't know anyone. 

During my travels, I learned yoga in San Francisco, Krav Maga in Seoul, calisthenics in Bali, gymnastics in London, partner acrobatics in Berlin, and finally, climbing once I returned to San Francisco for graduation. By the end, I had develop a unique, varied and rich relationship with movement which carries beautifully into the rest of my life. 

### 8. Prioritize both deep connections and ambient relationships

Most people have a tendency for one or the other. Figure out what you naturally lean towards, and make an effort in the other direction. 

It is important to have deep, soulful connections with people who witness your growth and development as a person. These people will be there for you in a significant way through hardship and triumphs. You need them. 

At the same time, it is equally important to have ambient relationships with people who have a more gentle presence in your life. These could be low maintenance friends, friends of friends, neighbors, people you run into at your regular cafe, or gym acquaintances. These people form the social fabric of your everyday living.  

The combination makes for a fuller life. 

### 9. Get rid of most things you own

It can be tempting to store things in your parent's house or a storage garage before you travel. But if you strip your belongings to exactly one suitcase, you will develop a sharp sense for what is essential and what is ephemeral. 

### 10. Document things that are special to you

Keep a detailed doc of places you absolutely love in each city, even down to the specific menu item you like to order or the time of day you like sitting on a specific bench in a specific park.

In time, you will start to cherish unexpected things that are hard to find on the map. You might find an alley that opens up to a scenic view in Itaewon, or you will run into a street vendor on Taksim Square that sells the best clams you have tasted, or you have a special reading spot on Exmouth Street that no one else knows about. After you have traveled enough, you will find that you are more drawn to these things than you are to what's typically considered exciting by tourists. And in those moments, you will be glad to have a document that tells you exactly how to get to that little soup shop in some underground market in Berlin.
