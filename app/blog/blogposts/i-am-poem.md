I am an AI engineer, 

but I am also, so much more

I have been so many things 

There was a time when

I was a designer,

graphic and web, 3D and UX

I went to design school

almost became an architect

And now I know my way

around scary software

made for serious designers

There was a time when

I was an artist

People said my paintings

looked like photographs

Maybe they were just being nice

now every wall in my parent’s home

has a painting that i made

There was a time when

I wanted to learn everything about the brain

now I look at people,

and I can tell that

electricity flows through them

that their feelings

don’t live in their brains

feelings, they travel

under our skin, through our veins

There was a time when

I wanted to learn everything,

about the pale blue dot

so I studied geology

now I look at rocks,

and I know the stories

of how they came to be

at least I think I do?

Did you know that

there are volcanoes under Antarctica?

That life has evolved to make do

without the sun

deep in the oceans 

where it is pitch dark

There was a time when

I wanted to learn everything about

creating consciousness out of nothing

Well, maybe not nothing

just the profound ability to imagine

more dimensions than we can touch

to travel in hyper-dimensional space

the profound ability to measure change

derivatives and differentials

the stuff of life, as it happens

right under our nose

the audacity to take a small slice

of what we know about the world

and use that to bore holes 

into uncertainty and the vast unknown

so we can tell the future

so we can be powerful

so we can feel safe

so we can make a dent

in something, or someone

kindred souls, maybe our own

I have been so many things

And I am so much more

But I am *also* an AI engineer

and sometimes, 

I want to play god

Just to see if I can succeed~
