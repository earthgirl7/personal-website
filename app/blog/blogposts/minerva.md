A year ago, I graduated from what’s been named the *[most innovative](https://www.wuri.world/2022-global-top-100)* university in the world.

“*What was it like going to Minerva?”* I get asked often, and even after four year of living this dream, I often find myself speechless. How do I condense a few lifetimes into a 90-second response?

Here is my attempt to share with you the incredible ways in which attending Minerva has transformed my person, life, and soul.

But first, I’ll provide context as to what Minerva is for those of you who either have no idea or a faint idea of what it is. This is an important prerequisite because Minerva is a very *unique* college model that departs liberally from what people normally think of when they think of an undergrad education. Feel free to skip this step if you know about Minerva already.

### So what is Minerva anyway? 
Minerva is a fully accredited, 4-year undergraduate university based out of San Francisco, with an acceptance rate of ~1%.

Following are key components of Minerva’s education model: 

- **Global Travel:** Minerva has a mandatory global travel program. Each cohort must travel to a different country *every semester*, and the locations are pre-determined. Freshman are always together in a country at any point in time, and so are the sophomores, juniors and seniors. We call it the global rotation, and it goes like this (for class of 2022):
    - Freshman Year: San Francisco
    - Sophomore Year: Seoul & Hyderabad
    - Junior Year: Berlin & Buenos Aires
    - Senior Year: London & Taipei
- **Diverse Community:** Despite being an American liberal arts college, Minerva has a 75% international student body, hailing from 50+ countries. In addition, in every country we go to, we are welcomed by a local staff team that organizes events, activities, and internships for us in partnership with local organizations and professionals. Therefore, in addition to being part of a highly diverse student body, we also get to engage meaningfully with local communities and organizations in 7 different countries.
- **Academic Curriculum:** This is the crux of why Minerva was created: to revitalize and revolutionize higher education. Our entire curriculum is built according to the latest education research and *science of learning* principles. Every class is designed to maximize student learning. I know this sounds like classic marketing material for any other university, but I am going to demonstrate to you through this article why these are not just bloated claims. In addition to a very intentional curriculum design, each class comes with a location-based assignment, where we are required to interact meaningfully with the context of the location we are in. For example, a geology assignment might require a student to collect rock samples of their rotation city for geological analysis, or a marketing assignment requiring students to interact with the marketing department of a local business to write a case study.
- **Software:** In order to deliver a science-of-learning-optimized education, Minerva has created an active-learning forum, which is a bespoke platform for empowering professors to teach and students to learn in the best way possible. It enables us to have highly interactive seminar-style classes, capped at 20 students. No, we don’t have lectures and we don’t have tests. But I promise you this software has helped me absorb knowledge in a way that no test or lecture could possibly achieve. And if you are thinking to yourself, “S*ounds like online classes on Zoom*”, then I can tell you from personal experience that it is a million times better. In fact, many of us would prefer learning on this platform over in-person classes when paired with a learning-optimized curriculum design.

### Navigating the Uniqueness of Being a Minervan

*“So what was it like going to Minerva?”*

*“I don’t know what just happened. Feels surreal. Um, I guess I’m special because I got selected into the most selective university in the world. I want to tell you that because you probably haven’t heard of Minerva so you probably think it’s some backwater college nobody cares about, but trust me Minerva is really cool and by association I am really cool. Oh and Minerva is revolutionizing higher education. What college did you go to? Yeah, they’ve got it all wrong with their archaic lecture halls and traditional tests. Oh, you graduated from an Ivy league? Yeah Minerva is much better. Anyways, we travel to 7 countries during our undergrad. It’s exhilarating. Did you do that? No? I am so sorry to hear about that. No we are not an* online *school. My god, please don’t say that again - it’s offensive.”*

I think to myself. What I actually end up saying out loud: 

“*It was brilliant. The best decision of my life. I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.”*

Satire aside…



Going to Minerva is surreal and dizzying. You know that you are part of a great experiment, and you choose to be part of it because you are a risk-taker with a strong flair for adventure and novelty. At least that was the case for me. I had the heart of a curious wanderer long before I got my acceptance letter for Minerva. 

- At 16, I left my home country of Pakistan and everyone I’d ever known, so I could live as a foreign exchange student in the American midwest for a whole year.
- At 17, I lived in Kenya for a month, collaborating with local schools to run sustainable development initiatives.
- At 18, I went to Chicago to practice peace journalism and speak on the national radio about my on-ground projects.
- At 19, I lived in Turkey for a full year to study and practice design in a professional design school.

It was in Turkey that I got a phone call from Minerva. I was in a library, whispering on the phone, when my whispers turned into a suppressed scream. I received angry hushed noises from the librarian. I didn’t care because I had been accepted into my dream school - and that, was the first dizzying moment of being a Minervan. 


### San Francisco as a Freshman

And so I made my first stop at the home city of Minerva - San Francisco. And I, dear reader, was blissfully unaware of what I was getting myself into. 

We lived in dorms right across from Uber and Twitter HQ, so I gauged that I am in close proximity to the Silicon Valley. It became the new normal for me to spend one evening at LinkedIn, another in Airbnb, and the weekend at Salesforce tower, lapping up all the free snacks of course. Fate had carefully placed me inside the nucleus of the tech industry, and I brushed it off like it was nothing because I had no intention of being in tech. After all, I was a snotty design student with strong opinions about line spaces and color palettes. Little did I know, attending Minerva would drastically change the way I make my career decisions. 

At this point, you are probably thinking, “*She definitely pivoted to tech for the money and clout because who wouldn’t.*” Really good guess, but that is not how it went. 

In fact, I still pursued design throughout my freshman year via extracurricular projects. My favorite one being when I led the branding and design efforts at a hackathon my colleagues and I organized in partnership with GitHub. Seeing my work plastered all over the GitHub headquarters made me feel incredibly thrilled about being a designer.

But I couldn’t take any design classes in my first year, because every freshman must enroll in an unusual set of cornerstone classes for the first year. And it goes like this: 

1. **Complex Systems**
    
    Focuses on agent interaction in networks and complex systems dynamics using concepts like multiple causality and emergence. Relevant to understanding a complex world, while being an effective leader, negotiator, and team-player. 
    
2. **Empirical Analysis**
    
    Learn to do good research by effectively framing problems, identifying solutions, developing and testing hypotheses, designing research studies, and reaching plausible conclusions.
    
3. **Formal Analysis**
    
    Focuses on critical thinking, formal logic, and algorithmic thinking using computational and quantitative approaches to analyzing and solving problems. 
    
4. **Multimodal Communications** 
    
    Learn to communicate effectively using different media and forms such as public-speaking, visual design, debate, and expressing yourself artistically. 
    

*“Okay, Anosha. Why are you explaining your classes to us? We are not going to remember any of this. Can we get to the point please?”*

The point is, these classes changed the way I see the world, and the way I will perceive learning for the rest of the my life. 

Back when I said that I was a snotty design student who intended to be a successful designer one day, I didn’t tell you why I chose that path. Part of the reason I chose this path was because I truly and deeply enjoyed arts and design growing up. But the other reason why I chose this path is because I was heavily, societally-reinforced into it. 

Just like my brother, I started to paint at a very early age. But unlike my brother, I was told repeatedly that I should be an artist, even when I was just 8 years old. I was encouraged to paint a lot, and my elders loved it. They didn’t love it so much when my brother did it, even thought he is amazing at it too. Something about being a girl who is interested in design, really struck with my parents, teachers and friends, because it presented no cognitive dissonance to their model of the world. What did confuse my elders was the fact that I also scored a solid 99% in my math exams, and that I’d drink up encyclopedias for fun as an 8 year old, and that I’d read my entire science curriculum before the school year started. Elements of this showed up later in my life too, when my school principal looked me in the eye and said, “Girls can’t do computer science”. For context, I grew up in Pakistan - a heavily patriarchal society. 

The parts of my passions that felt desirable to the elders were reinforced, and the parts of my passions that they didn’t understand, perhaps due to bias or chance, were ignored. So I chose to go down a design path, because somewhere in my childhood, it was drilled into me that that is the path I must choose. 

Coming back to Minerva. 

Taking these cornerstone classes touched all the important aspects of my being, and they did not assume that I am good at one thing or another. Everyone was expected to learn to do good research, think analytically, communicate effectively, and see the world in all of its complexity. As I went through the cornerstone classes, I rediscovered my curiosity for quantitative analyses and problem-solving, and it did not contradict with the way I was able to express myself artistically. I learned to analyze research and practice it myself, while at the same time, finding ways to work with the complex systems that permeate our natural world. 

And so, bit by bit, the top-down, arbitrary restrictions I put on myself about what I can do, what I want to do, and what I must do, dissolved. 

Come the end of freshman year. I no longer know what I want to do with my life.

### Seoul  & Global Rotation

Here comes the much-awaited global rotation. My first time traveling to Seoul, South Korea. 

Minerva students only get 3 days to get acquainted to a new country, so when I landed in Seoul, I carefully executed my protocol like clockwork. 

*Find local cash.* 

*Get a taxi.* 

*Check in to the dorms.*

 *Find the nearest grocery store, laundry machine, and a cafe with outlets.* 

*Update location on my socials.* 

*Sleep.* 

Something I’ve learned about traveling through Minerva is that travel doesn’t have to look like anything. When I first landed in Seoul, I desperately wanted to do everything that the Google SEO spit out when I searched, “Top 10 Things to do in Seoul”. If I don’t go to Jeju, have I really been to South Korea? How will I prove to anyone that I was in Seoul if I don’t have a photo at Namsan Park? If we let the tourism industry dictate the way we travel, we miss out on an incredible opportunity to learn about an entire culture and way of life. And after being a tourist for a while, all the places start to look the same anyway. 

I don’t remember visiting Meongdong for pictures as dearly as I do the owner of a local restaurant who’d invite us over for dinners on the house, and tell us about his life through a translator. My favorite cafe staff didn’t speak good english, but when I was leaving, they knew how much I liked their brownies, so they translated the recipe for me as a going away gift. I remember vividly the day a North Korean refugee shared with us the nitty gritty details of how she escaped. 

I no longer find a desire in myself to be a tourist, rushing through countries to collect flags on my bio. What I do desire to step into the inner worlds and lives of people who are infinitely unique. To be invited to a dinner by a family who has a very different culture than the one I grew up in, is exponentially more endearing to me than a snorkeling trip. 

I was in Korea for four months. Four months is simultaneously a very long and a very short period of time. It was short enough that I couldn’t make long-lasting friendships with locals, but it was long enough that I got a glimpse into the local culture by living various parts of it.

Sadly, this was also our last pre-covid semester.

### ~~Hyderabad~~  Bali and the Pandemic

The pandemic hit. The world halted. I was sipping coconuts in Bali. It was bizarre.

Bali is not a Minerva city, but I went there when the rest of my cohort went to India. As a Pakistani, I was advised against going to India due to political tensions. 

While many of my fellow classmates were stuck in India and Argentina, I was *stuck* in Bali. 

“*Oh no, poor Anosha was stuck in* Bali *for the Pandemic.* 🙄*”*

I admit I got lucky, but I was also terrified of being alone on an island while the future of the world became deeply uncertain. My classmates had each other, but I just had myself because I went to Bali alone. And so I learned: 

- To find myself a community of nomadic women, who supported me emotionally and physically when the going got tough. For example, when I got the flu and was unable to move, my dear friends left lots of food and flowers at my doorstep so I didn’t have to worry about it.
- To have a hobby that made me feel alive. I chose calisthenics, design, and creative modeling. I took on my first big freelance project as a web designer for an Italian luxury food company.
- To have grace. The Balinese people did not panic the way Westerners did. Our supermarkets were full and the community supported each other while their main source of income was ripped from the island. Being surrounded by such a people helped me retain a calm nervous system. Of course the coconuts, beaches, and swimming pools helped, but no amount of beach can give you emotional strength the way faith can.

While all of this was happening, I continued to take classes. Since our classes are hosted on the active learning forum, our academics were not affected in the slightest. 


### Heart-Centered Learning

You are probably wondering at this point about what I decided to major in, since I was no longer going to do design. In sophomore year, I went full explore mode. I took the classes I wanted to, with little thought as to what major it would make. I wanted to take a bottom-up approach to figure out what excites me the most. I took classes in geology, finance, philosophy, causal inference, neuroscience and the likes. 

And it was glorious. I thoroughly enjoyed learning, in a way that I have never done so before. And I suspect it has something to do with the science of learning principles that are baked into a Minerva education. We don’t have lectures, and we don’t have traditional tests, but we do have a unique format of classes that leave students with no option but to learn.  

Before we attend a class, we must do pre-class work, which is basically homework. Sounds pretty standard, right? The thing is, doing the pre-class work is critical to attending a class. At the start of class, you must submit your pre-class work and if you don’t, then you’re marked absent. During class, you engage in a highly interactive discussion with the teacher and other students that builds upon the pre-class work. Unlike lectures, you can’t just mentally zone out of Minerva classes, because the platform measures the total talk time of each student, and the professor can easily call on you anytime. You can’t turn off your camera either. You must be there in all of your presence, and you must engage. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but this kind of highly interactive seminar-style class design is my favorite way of learning. 

There is a lot that I am leaving out for the sake of brevity (trust me I am trying *really hard* to be concise even if it doesn’t seem like it). At it’s core, Minerva education is built in a highly intentional way and the educational principles are continuously updated based on student feedback and the latest research in education science. And I love that because it is significantly more student-oriented than any other major university that I know of in the United States. 

**Trigger Warning: Nerd Incoming**

I do believe that learning is a two-way street, because the best education system in the world cannot leave a dent on a mind that isn’t open. I personally approached my learning in an almost primal, animalistic way. Alongside an open-mind, I brought an open heart and let myself *feel* everything that I learned. It was exhilarating. 

How rocks tell us about the origin of life, and how the material of life moves through volcanoes, and how there are volcanoes under glaciers. How thoroughly complex the brain is, and how it can’t tell the difference between an emotion and a thought. The nature of causality and how the perfect doctor problem leaves us with uncomfortable mysteries. The process of giving birth to a consciousness from first principles, and to witness mind boggling emergence in neural networks. Sometimes, when I was learning about matrices or Markov chains, it felt like my heart would fall out of my chest. A spiritual experience. 

Funnily enough, one of the science of learning principles  is called “affective context”. It is the idea that emotional associations tend to improve learning and memory retention. 

The rate at which I was absorbing knowledge was unprecedented, and I was having an incredible time learning in this way. I don’t think every Minerva student felt this way about our classes, and I can’t say for sure that the curriculum design intended for this, but this is one of the ways that my undergrad felt thoroughly invigorating to not just to my mind, but also my feeling self. 

Having explored all that interested me in the span of time that was available to me, I realized that I found the concept of consciousness and the process of creating it out of thin air (chips, in this case), particularly interesting. My chosen classes gave me a CS degree with a concentration in AI and Machine Learning. Little did I realize at the time, that my graduation date would coincide with the launch of ChatGPT and a global AI boom cycle.

I am so glad that I decided to untangle from the top-down influences of my upbringing to find what it is that excites me. 


### ~~Buenos Aires & Taipei~~   London & Berlin: Reflections

Unfortunately due to the pandemic, we could not go to Buenos Aires and Taipei, but we did spend a semester each in London and Berlin.

Being a senior, I reflected back on my four years and realized that despite a strong pandemic-induced disruption, I grew so much as a result of the global travel, academics, and professional opportunities that came through Minerva. At the same time, I started to feel the downsides of being on the road perpetually while figuring out my life and holding on to friendships and connections I made with people along the way. 

Here are some of my reflections: 

- **Find the kind of travel that feels energy-giving to *you*:**
I like slow travel significantly more than vacations, tourism, and any trip that last less than a month. Ideally, I’d prefer to not buy a round-trip ticket at all. Living in places for months on end, while finding ways to integrate into the local culture is deeply transformative for me. In fact, I wish Minerva’s 4 years/7 cities model was instead a 4 years/4 cities model, because a semester felt so short to me. But at the same time, I have classmates who loved to travel around even when they were already traveling as part of the global rotation. For example, lots of Minervans went to Japan and Thailand for weekend trips during our time in Korea.
- **Diversity of experiences is essential to growth:**
The sheer diversity of my experiences give me a personal and professional robustness that I would not trade for a spot at any of the ivy leagues. At this point, I’ve worked with people/companies from Japan, Italy, Argentina, United States, and India. I have mentored 20+ students. I’ve collaborated within a really complex network of teams to launch a community platform for 1500+ travelers. I have become someone who can walk up to anyone, in any room, anywhere in the world, and strike up a memorable conversation. I have the confidence to navigate any kind of difficult situation given any amount of resources. I am able to communicate effectively no matter how complicated the concept, and I have the ability to see unintuitive connections between very complex ideas floating in the world.
- **Find a healthy balance of novelty and predictability to feel good in life:** 
Living an intense life of novelty for 4 years felt incredibly tiring. It was hard to date or make new friends because why would anyone invest in a relationship with a deadline? The easiest friendships were with classmates who were in the same boat (plane, actually), as well as travelers who found transience more comfortable. In every city, I found a cafe and quickly became a regular there. I built friendships with cafe staff, and they’d give me little gifts every now and then. I craved consistency, belonging, and comfort because I was always living outside my comfort zone, and my world was always changing. Throughout senior year, I craved to sign a year-long lease so I can stay put in one location for more than 4 months. I was looking forward to the mundane tasks of buying furniture and plants, and not having to move again for at least a year.
- **Letting go of notions of superiority and inferiority is important to being a healthy human being:**
Minerva tends to attract some of the smartest, most insightful and uniquely-exceptional students from around the world. Entering Minerva after a successful academic career as a type-A overachiever with a trail of awards and scholarships behind me, I was doomed to ride the wave of imposter syndrome. Suddenly, I was no longer the coolest person in the room, because the girl to the left of me had published a book, and the guy to the right of me had sold a company, and the person behind me had solved an important math problem for the world. But overtime, I realized that I cannot put myself and all of my classmates on a linear scale of success. All of us have been dealt a different set of cards in life, and all of us bring a different kind of beauty and uniqueness to the way that we participate in and respond to the world around us.

No amount of storytelling feels sufficient. The limits of language, time, existence, emotion, cognition, and eyeballs will haunt me, but I promised myself I will create and let my creations live in the world rent free. I hope to share more stories in the future. Thank you for being here 💙
