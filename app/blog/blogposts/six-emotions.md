For decades, scientists and technologists have entertained the idea that humans have 6 basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, and happiness. This concept has heavily influenced emotion-related scientific research and innovation, but I find it deeply surprising that such a simplistic theory is the most compelling one we could come up with. So I did some digging, and turns out, this theory is heavily contested by serious people. 

Psychologists would categorize the six-basic-emotions theory as “folk psychology” i.e. the lay *folk* having simplified beliefs about human psychology that may or not align with scientific psychological findings. A telling sign is when such beliefs appear as de facto when you vocalize them over brunch with your besties. 

So where did the six-basic-emotions theory come from? 

## Faculty Psychology: A Paradigm of the Mind

Our 18th century understanding of the human mind was quite simplistic. Back then, we thought of the mind as composed of distinct and modular faculties, each responsible for specific mental functions. This “faculty psychology" approach was first put into the collective consciousness by philosophers such as Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), Christian Wolff (1679-1754) and Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and has trickled all the way into the 21st century as a dominant theoretical framework. Now, with neuroimaging technology at our disposal, neuroscience research advancements, an incoming paradigm of complex systems thinking, it is becoming more evident that the brain is not made of distinct modules with distinct roles. Currently, we don’t have sufficient evidence to support a emotion-to-brain faculty mapping.(1) In other words, don’t ask serious people about the location of different emotions inside the brain. 

## Darwin: Facial Expressions

Did you know that the first ever recorded emotion recognition study was conducted by Darwin? In fact, Charles Darwin was the first person to use photographs to in a scientific publication to illustrate emotional expressions. These photos are rather odd, but they lead to pioneering research in emotion science. Basically, Darwin argued that emotional expressions are evolutionarily adaptive, and that there are certain core facial/bodily expressions that are innate across cultures and species. In order to demonstrate this, he obtained 11 photographs where people’s faces are electrically stimulated to produce certain human emotions. Then, he (likely) hosted a dinner party with 20 of his friends, and let them discuss how many different emotions they can detect in these faces. While the guests unanimously agreed on a small number of emotions, such as sadness, fear, surprise, and happiness, they strongly disagreed on the more subtle expressions. 

Darwin’s work goes on to inspire Silver Tomkins, a psychologist and philosopher who his own theory on the universality of emotion. 

And, uh, why do we care about this Tomkins dude? 

We care about Tomkins because Tomkins ends up mentoring Paul Ekman, who is the psychologist responsible for popularizing the six-basic-emotions theory. 

## Paul Ekman

Paul Ekman hypothesized that if there are universal emotions across cultures, then an isolated people who had never seen emotions of the outside world will be able to recognize them regardless. In 1960s, Ekman visited a small indigeneous community on the highlands of Papua New Guinea that had stayed largely untouched by the Western world. Ekman was meticulous in ruling out any possibility of Western influences. His screening criteria for the study subjects included people who did not speak English, never saw movies, never lived in Western settlements or government towns, and never worked for any western missionaries, U.S. scientists, government workers, traders e.t.c. 

Ekman was able to gather about 189 adults and 130 children from the South Fore community for his study. His first visit was not too successful due to a lack of proper planning and understanding of the cultural context, but the second time he went, he struck a chord with the locals. Ekman would show the Fore people three photographs and tell them a story, after which they were to pick the photos that they thought fit the story best. In return, Ekman would present them with cigarettes or a bar of soap, which they liked. At the end of the experiments, the locals expressed their heartfelt respect to Paul Ekman in the way that they thought was most honorable, which was to let him know that if he died, he would be one of the people they’d find worthy of devouring.

As for the results of the experiments, the Fore matched emotional expressions to stories in a similar way as people in Western cultures would do. The only emotion that they did not differentiate between was surprise and fear. Ekman also reversed this experiment slightly, by asking the Fore people to demonstrate facial expressions for certain emotions. These emotional expressions were videotaped and sent to college students in the US, who were able to,
for the most part, accurately detect the emotions.

Ekman published his findings in influential journals, and went on to publish more hot research about micro-expressions and lie detection.
